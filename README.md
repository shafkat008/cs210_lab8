# Lab Exercise

This program consists of a "check-out line" simulation program (storesim.cpp), and a header file for implementing the Queue (queuelnk.h). In this exercise, the Queue is implemented as a linked list.

Your primary tasks for this exercise are the following:

1. implement the enqueue function in queuelnk.h
2. add code to the "check-out line" simulation program (storesim.cpp) to get it up and running. Comments are included in this file to give you further details.

As a general overview, add code to:

- Implement the enqueue function according to the comments in queuelnk.h
- Implement the check-out line simulation according to the comments in storesim.cpp
- Run the program, trying the test plan cases in the table below.
